#  Diffusion models for dataset generation in case of limited data

This project explores the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic datasets in scenarios where real-world data is scarce. Specifically, we focus on augmenting a dataset of satellite images of Ukrainian agricultural fields affected by bombing during the war.

## Overview

Training robust computer vision models typically requires large amounts of annotated data. In real-world scenarios — especially conflict zones — obtaining such datasets can be extremely challenging.
This project leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic satellite images of bombed and not bombed fields, expanding the limited real-world dataset.
We aim to evaluate whether such synthetic data can help improve classification models' performance when real data is limited.
